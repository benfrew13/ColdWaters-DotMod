Presenting: DotMod for Cold Waters.

This is an attempt to create a more organized mod that is closer to vanilla vessel and weapons characteristics than other, currently-existing mods. This also generally results in more realistic sensor comparisons.
While DM incorporates some stuff from EM made by our developers (and other items which we have the right to use), it is built from the ground up on the base game to avoid many of the flaws found in that mod, some of which would take more time to fix than re-do from scratch.
(EM) - that marks features also working in EM

This is an early Beta release, and will be tweaked and improved based on feedback and additional sources where possible. We encourage you to join our Discord at: https://discord.gg/DrmztcDYYf to help us further tweak the mod to give the best possible experience. We also hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoy working on it!

We are still in the process of creating documentation. Expect that with the final release of the mod.

[INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS]
WINDOWS (NOT WINDOWS 7 OR PRIOR):
Download the release .zip from the GitHub page. Extract the contents of the .zip file into a folder somewhere where you can find it.
Then, navigate to the Cold Waters directory in which you wish to install the mod in File Explorer. Right click on the address bar and select "Copy as text."
Return to where you extracted the mod, and launch DotModInstaller.exe. Follow the instructions present in the installer.
Then, the mod should be installed to Jone Soft Generic Mod Enabler (JSGME), which may be called "EpicModInstall" if you used that mod prior to DotMod. Launch that and enable DotMod, as well as any addons you have installed alongside DotMod.
Launch ColdWaters, and if the loading screen appears, you have done everything correctly. Enjoy!

Changelog (INCOMPLETE):
[KNOWN ISSUES/WIP]
Many models are still WIP and requires remodel/retexturing
Norwegian surface ships are kitbash placeholders
SAM trails are placeholders and require replacement
Not all playble surface ships have deployable towed arrays
P-6 missile is used as substitute for P-35 and P-500 until they get their own models
Mobile decoys on surface ships will float in the air during time compression (Found by Who_Even_Knows)
MacOS Compatability is Dubious

[CAMPAIGN]
Soviet Campaign (1984)
Expanded RPG Mode: Prestige system, player ranks, ability to change mission and vessel
Custom transit backgrounds for most vessels
Reykjavik, Narvik and Bergen harbor scenery now all have landstrike targets

Royal Navy Campaign (1984)
Initial WIP Campaign for feedback (and because TheHappyYachter like the Royal Navy)

[GAME]
Self noise and sensor strength reworked by Daniil
Bundle import code improved by TheHappyYachter
New loading screen by TheHappyYachter
Loading time on game start improved by TheHappyYachter
New game options by TheHappyYachter
New single missions (More coming!)
Russian descriptions rewritten and corrected
Soviet campaign made from scratch
A lot of soviet subs are playable
(EM) Russian voiceover by Evgeny Mas a.k.a. Ramius
Proximity fuses for torpedoes are now implemented thanks to Dsmirnoff
For first time installer the game will now check for the existence of an override folder on first load. This should help reduce the number of people who have issues when they have removed Epic Mod by renaming the override folder to stop DotMod reading it. This happens only on first load.

[GAME MECHANICS]
Player SAMs can target enemy aircraft and missiles, and, depending on the type of missile, also surface ships for a long-range ASuW weapon. They are, of course, not very effective in this role.
Old SS boats are faster on the surface
The AI no longer autodetects weapons if they do not know they are there
Fully functional surface to air missilies with ability to switch target type
Secondary SAM that works automatically and targets approaching missiles
Civilian vessels will mask a submarine's noise
CIWS will target aircraft
(EM) Deployable towed arrays

[GUI]
Additional buttons:
 + Increase depth by 100m
 + Decrease depth by 100m
 + Go to max missile launch depth
 + Deploy chaff button
 
Clear to Leave indicator (Next to the button to go active)
Panel for player SAM
Aircraft map icons (non-clickable)
Missile map icons (clickable)
Player current noise displayed on tacmap
Fantastic UI assets for the new vessels built by none other than SteelShark. Without his 2D art none of the new models would be as playable as they are. He has also provided the new HUD elements like Periscope masks, individually selected for the nations based on Open Source
Intelligence.
A new console menu has been added (Shift + `) this is a nicer implementation than the original and will allow you to inspect the game log without exiting the game. It also allows you to input console commands.

Our team also wants thank several people for their help and inspiration:
Nils a.k.a. Julhelm - Without you there would not be CW and without your help our mod would be missing small, yet critical, info! We'd also like to thank you for that Marmoset material that kept our ships hidden by fog. 
Gsmith93 - We thank you for your incredible 1990 campaign! It gave us such a good base to work off of and saved us so much time.
Oleg Vygovsky - You've showed that impossible is actually possible and provided info and support
Nikita Nichagin - If you hadn't called Dot to CW, we woldnt be here now! Additionally, thanks for the info and support through the years.
Kostya Martynov - Your analysis and info you've posted in your group was very valuable for creation of this mod.
Evgeny Mas - Your voiceover adds an incredible amount of immersion to playing Russian vessels.
Epic - Credits for ideas on chaff and WH behaviour and assistance in WH parameters setup, Shkval sprite and several medals sprites and edited parameters of the wake trals. It was fun to improve EM, but sadly your attitude eventually drove all content makers from the project.

Electric Boat would like to thank by name the following:
George Bieda (Windjammers Arts) and TheFloatingDrydock - For all the drawings that constitute my main reference for all US Navy vessels, and
Boris Volkhov (Polar Bear Productions) - For static scale models and drawings that are my constant and most precious source of reference for all soviet submarines.

Special thanks is also given to model makers who have uploaded thier models for anyone to use, especially on 3D Warehouse!
