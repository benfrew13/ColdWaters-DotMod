WeaponDescriptiveName=Mark 45 Mod 1 Torpedo
WeaponDescription=The Mark 45 was the only nuclear ASW torpedo in service with the USN, intended for use against high-speed, deep-diving, enemy submarines. Westinghouse also marketed a conventional version as the 'Freedom Torpedo'. This Mod 1 is a conjectural weapon assuming nuclear torpedoes would be 'field modified' in a conventional war.
